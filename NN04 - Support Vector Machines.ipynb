    "<img src=\"svm.png\",width=300,height=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we need to: \n",
    "1. input data in vector space, \n",
    "2. if the data is non-linearly separable, use the kernel trick to simulate transform data into higher-dimensional space (until classes can be separated by a hyperplane). Details of how this is achieved are outlined below.  \n",
    "3. construct parallel hyperplanes to separate classes. \n",
    "4. convex optimisation of these hyperplanes to maximise functional margin between support vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advangates of SVM**:   \n",
    "- regularisation parameter, which makes the user think about avoiding over-fitting. \n",
    "- kernel trick, so you can build in expert knowledge about the problem via engineering the kernel. \n",
    "- SVM is defined by a convex optimisation problem (no local minima) for which there are efficient methods (e.g. SMO). - it is an approximation to a bound on the test error rate, and there is a substantial body of theory behind it which suggests it should be a good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of SVM**: \n",
    "-  In a way the SVM moves the problem of over-fitting from optimising the parameters to model selection. Sadly kernel models can be quite sensitive to over-fitting the model selection criterion, see G. C. Cawley and N. L. C. Talbot, Over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2010. Research, vol. 11, pp. 2079-2107, July 2010.) \n",

    "- **Gamma** - Kernel coefficient for ‘rbf’, ‘poly’ and ‘sigmoid’. Higher the value of gamma, will try to exact fit the as per training data set i.e. generalization error and cause over-fitting problem.\n",
    "- **C** - Penalty parameter C of the error term. It also controls the trade off between smooth decision boundary and classifying the training points correctly."
