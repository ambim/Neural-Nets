    "# NN03: Self-organising maps\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook: \n",
    "- Self-organising maps\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce the Self-organising map architecture, first we need to introduce a few new concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Competitive learning \n",
    "In competitive learning, the neurons compete with each other to determine a winner - after competition, only one neuron will have a positive activition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically: \n",
    "- let *m* denote the dimension of the input space. \n",
    "- let **x** = [x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub> ... x<sub>m</sub>] be an input vector. \n",
    "- Let **W**<sub>j</sub> = [W<sub>j1</sub>, W<sub>j2</sub> ... W<sub>jm</sub>] be the weight vector of the neuron j (j=1,2..n); where *n* is the total number of neurons in the network). \n",
    "\n",
    "**2D feature map:**\n",
    "<img src=\"map.png\",width=350,height=350>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Winning criteria** \n",
    "The neuron whose weight vector **best matches** the current input vector wins: \n",
    "- compare inner product **W**<sub>j</sub>**x** for j = 1,2,...,n and select the largest. \n",
    "- Alternatively, minimize the Euclidean distance between **W**<sub>j</sub> and **x**\n",
    "<img src=\"euc.png\",width=150,height=150>\n",
    "...where i(x) identifies the neuron i that best matches input x\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Co-operation \n",
    "Co-operation: the winning neuron locates the centre of the topological neighbourhood of co-operating neurons. \n",
    "\n",
    "A firing neuron tends to excite the neurons in the immediate neighbourhood more than those far away. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let *h<sub>ji</sub>* denote a neighbourhood centred on winning neuron i and containing a set of co-operating neurons, one of which is j. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let *d<sub>ji</sub>* denote the distance between winning neuron i and its neighbour j. \n",
    "- we want *h<sub>ji</sub>* to be symmetric w.r.t *d<sub>ji</sub>*\n",
    "- we want *h<sub>ji</sub>* to decrease monotonically with increasing *d<sub>ji</sub>*\n",
    "- a typical choice is the Gaussian function \n",
    "<img src=\"coop.png\",width=300,height=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "A SOM is biologically plausible as Competition implements *lateral inhibition*, and Co-operation implements *lateral interaction*. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Synaptic adaptation\n",
    "For the network to be self-organising, the weight vectors are required to change according to the input vector. \n",
    "A variation of Hebb's rule is used: \n",
    "<img src=\"hebbb.png\",width=150,height=150>\n",
    "This has the effect of *moving* the weight vector W<sub>i</sub> of winning neuron i towards the input vector x, and the weight vector of neighbouring neurons W<sub>j</sub> towards x but less than W<sub>i</sub> (with discount *h<sub>ji</sub>*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon repeated presentations of training data, the weight vectors follow the distribution of the input vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties of self-organising maps\n",
    "- **Dimensionality reduction**: self organising maps transform input pattern of arbitrary dimension into one or two dimension discrete map. \n",
    "- **Feature extraction**: given data from an input space with a non-linear distribution, the SOM is able to select a set of best features for approximating the distribution. \n",
    "- **Topological ordering**: the feature map computed by the SOM is topologically ordered in the sense that the spatial location of a neuron in the lattice corresponds to a particular domain or feature of input patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications: \n",
    "- locating similar patterns in maps and satellite images (e.g. meteorology). \n",
    "- to predict potential areas for good oil prospecting based on geological data. \n",
    "- organisation and retrieval from large document collection (WEBSOM).\n",
    "- dimensionality reduction before computer vision tasks (due to its topological ordering qualities: \n",
